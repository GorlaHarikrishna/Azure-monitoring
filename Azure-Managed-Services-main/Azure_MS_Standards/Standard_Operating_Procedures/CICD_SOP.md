# Process for Maintaining Environments

1. **Deployment Authorization Policy**
   - **Purpose:** This policy outlines the procedures and requirements for authorizing deployments through the CI/CD pipeline to production environments.

2. **Roles and Responsibilities**
   - **Administrators:** Responsible for configuring access controls, permissions, and defining deployment authorization policies.
   - **Engineers:** Responsible for developing and testing code changes. Engineers initiate deployment requests through the CI/CD pipeline but cannot deploy changes directly to production environments.
   - **Deployment Approvers:** Designated individuals responsible for authorizing deployments to production environments. They review proposed changes and ensure they meet quality and security standards before approving deployments.

3. **Authorization Process**
   - **Code Review and Testing:** Engineers commit code changes to version control repositories. Changes undergo automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and possibly other quality checks such as code linting and security scans.
   - **Deployment Request:** Once automated tests pass, engineers submit deployment requests through the CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Manual Approval:** Deployment requests trigger a manual approval process. Deployment Approvers receive notifications and review the proposed changes. They assess the impact on production environments, verify compliance with coding standards, security requirements, and business rules.
   - **Authorization Decision:** Deployment Approvers approve or reject deployment requests based on their assessment. Only approved deployments proceed to the next stage.
   - **Deployment Execution:** Authorized deployments are automatically deployed to production environments by the CI/CD pipeline.

4. **Access Controls and Permissions**
   - **CI/CD Pipeline Access:** Only authorized users with appropriate roles and permissions can access and trigger deployments through the CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Branch Protection:** Certain branches, such as main or release branches, are protected to prevent unauthorized changes. Only authorized individuals can push changes to these branches, triggering deployment processes.

5. **Monitoring and Audit**
   - **Audit Logs:** The CI/CD systems maintain audit logs documenting deployment activities, including who initiated deployments, when they occurred, and the outcome (approved or rejected).
   - **Monitoring:** Administrators monitor deployment activities and review audit logs regularly to ensure compliance with the authorization policy. Any unauthorized deployments are promptly investigated and addressed.

6. **Policy Compliance**
   - **Training and Awareness:** All personnel involved in the CI/CD process receive training on the deployment authorization policy and their respective roles and responsibilities.
   - **Enforcement:** Non-compliance with the deployment authorization policy may result in disciplinary action, including access restrictions or termination of privileges.

7. This policy ensures that all deployments through the CI/CD pipeline to production environments are properly authorized, reviewed, and compliant with organizational standards and requirements.
